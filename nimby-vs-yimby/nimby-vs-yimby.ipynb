    "During the second iteration of DoltHub's USA housing price data bounty a large amount of public real estate data was scraped, wrangled and imported into a version-controlled database. This enables us to do some exploration and analysis for the purpose of gaining insight into the dynamics of real estate market. Some parts of United States are said to suffer from NIMBYism - a resistance to new property developments in area. One famous example is Marc Andreesen, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, going out of his way to prevent new housing to be built in his town - Atherton, CA. But perhaps there's also areas that welcome and support new real estate projects? By wielding the power of programming and open data, we are able to leverage the `us-housing-prices-v2` database and find which are which. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to data analysis approach is going to be as follows. We are going to limit data being analysed to timeframe from 2009 June 30 to 2020 January 1. This will provide us 10.5 years worth of data from the times between the official end of Great Recession of 2008 to the very beginning of the current quite complicated decade. Thus we will be looking into steady-state trends from relatively recent past period that had no major shocks to the entire real estate market. Furthermore, we are going to narrow our view into the initial records of property being sold, which implies that a property is newly built and just entered the market. We are going to count such initial sales for each county represented in the database. Some counties are geographically large, some are populous, some are small in area and/or population. To accomplish an apples to apples comparison we are going to normalise number of initial sales by population and by land area. Lastly, we are going to compute standard deviation values for each county from per capita and per area values to appreciate how much they stand out."

    "We believe that data analysis should be reproducible. Reproducibility of data science requires two pillars: open data and free, open software. In this particular case, open data requirement is fullfilled by `us-housing-prices-v2` database, hosted on DoltHub. The latter requirement is fullfilled by Dolt DMBS and a Pythonic data science environment based on Jupyter. We did the heavy lifting of tabular data with Pandas library. To establish connection between Dolt running in server mode and Pandas we used MySQL connector Python module with SQLAlchemy (Dolt is compatible-enough with MySQL for this to work). Plotly was used to visualise county-level data on interactive map view. Some supporting geospatial data was downloaded with Python `requests` module."
